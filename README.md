# AI-Based Chatbot

This project is an AI-based chatbot implemented in Python. The chatbot utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand and respond to user inputs.

## Features

- Rule-based responses for specific patterns
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) for understanding user input
- Extendable for more sophisticated interactions

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Install required packages by running: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-based-chatbot.git
    cd ai-based-chatbot
    ```

2. Run the chatbot:

    ```bash
    python chatbot.py
    ```

3. Interact with the chatbot through the console.

## Configuration

- Customize the rules in the `pairs` list in `chatbot.py` for specific chatbot responses.
- Explore advanced NLP libraries or machine learning frameworks for more complex interactions.

## Examples

### Rule-Based Interaction

User: "What is your name?"
Chatbot: "My name is Chatbot and I'm here to help you."

### Exit

User: "quit"
Chatbot: "Goodbye! Have a great day."
